While you're standing in line for a ride, you and your friends decide to
play a game where you all tell a story, by each saying one word at a time in
turn.

Practice adding together strings by writing six separate words, each wrapped
in their own set of quotations, and using the plus sign to contacenate the strings.
Use the "puts" command at the beginning of your line of code to print your results
to the terminal.
